"# TweetKMeans" 
Twitter provides a service for posting short messages. In practice, many of the tweets are very
similar to each other and can be clustered together. By clustering similar tweets together, we can
generate a more concise and organized representation of the raw tweets, which will be very
useful for many Twitter-based applications (e.g., truth discovery, trend analysis, search ranking,
etc.)
In this assignment, you will learn how to cluster tweets by utilizing Jaccard Distance metric and
K-means clustering algorithm.
